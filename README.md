# onMRZ
This is a library that parses a machine readable zone found in Machine readable Documents for instance (Passport).
It parses PassportNumber, First and LastName, dates like date of birth, expire date as well as nationality and issuing country.

It can also generate the MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) if all the proper parameters are passed to it.
